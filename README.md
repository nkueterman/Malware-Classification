# Malware-Classification

The classification of malware data is an essential problem at the forefront of cyber security.  Having the capability to find and identify malicious software is increasingly becoming more important as the internet and device interconnectivity rapidly expand in todayâ€™s society.
The approaches used in this study are scaled back in terms of data usage.  The BIG 2015 dataset includes both an assembler source (.asm) file as well as the binary (.bytes) file but only the binary files were used in the classification process.  Leveraging the assembly code is much more demanding as it must be decrypted and analyzed via program outputs.  Doing this to thousands of files would take immense processing times.  If these dynamic code approaches are employed in real-time the malware might have enough time to deploy some or all of the malicious content.
